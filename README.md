# SQL Employee Tracker

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to create a simple way of tracking employees and their departments.

- I built this project to strengthen my knowledge of node and mysql.

- This project is looking to create an easy way to find, add, and organize employees within departments.

I learned a lot about how databases are structured and how to utilize node to add and remove objects from tables within the database.
